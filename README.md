For my first project, we had to make something related to space by using generic shapes so i decided to make a moon with an ellipse and use lines for the wording.

For Project 2, We had to do the same thing but this time adding in color, so i made a balloons, a sky and paper air planes.

For project 3, we had to use bounds and include mouse commands, so if you click, you spawn a bubble of a random green color.

For project 4, we had to use various interactions. So what i did was make a ball that bounces on the walls, and when you click the mouse the background changes colors and the ball pattern resets.

As for the last project, project 5, we had to use create buttons. What i did was make two buttons to two different final fantasy based worlds, and when you click a button it displays certain text.
